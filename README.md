# Meme-Stock-Detector
A meme stock detector. Scrapes stock ticker data from the subreddit r/WallStreetBets and sends it via email to a list of people. Can be used to predict markets to a degree.
In the code, I read in a CSV file as input to check against the stock data being recieved from reddit. The CSV is a list of stock tickers. In order for the code to function properly, you need to first download the CSV, save it to a local folder, and then update the Python code to reflect your local file path.
You can run the .py file to see the code in action
Note that to run this code you need to download all the packages that you dont have currently downloaded
